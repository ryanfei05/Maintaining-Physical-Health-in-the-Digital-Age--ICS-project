		What Impacts does Digital Technology have on your Physical Health?
		</h2>
		<p>There is without a doubt that the rise of digital technology hasnâ€™t impacted our lives for the better. You can socialize with anyone on the internet with the click of a button, information and knowledge opportunities are everywhere, and in regards to our physical health, we can track our fitness progress right on our personal devices.</p>
		<p> However, with everyone becoming more and more dependent on digital technology in their daily lives, this has also resulted in greater technology overuse. As of October 2021, <strong>4.88</strong> billion people are on the internet, and a recent study of over 10,000 people in 5 countries found that the average time spent consuming digital media was <strong>7</strong> hours a day. </p>
		<p>As a result, there must be a smart and effective use of digital technology to combat the negative effects that arise with overuse of technology.</p>
		<p>The following article will dive deep into the problems concerning your physical health with respect to the usage of digital technology, which includes:</p>
		<strong>		
		<ul>
			<li><a href="index.html#DES">Digital Eye Strain</a></li>
			<li><a href="index.html#PP">Poor Posture</a></li>
			<li><a href="index.html#SD">Sleep Disorders</a></li>
			<li><a href="index.html#PI">Physical Inactivity</a></li>
		</ul>

		Digital Eye Strain

		<p>When you look at a screen for prolonged periods of time, you often forget to blink, leading to dried out eyes, and your eyes could be exerting extra effort just to maintain a clear image on your screen. Even those with perfect vision may experience the symptoms of digital eye strain, which includes: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Dry Eyes</li>
			<li>Headaches</li>
			<li>Blurry vision</li>
			<li>Burning & itchy eyes</li>
			<li>Eye pain</li>
			<li>Excessive blinking</li>
			<li>Neck & shoulder pain</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Nearly 70% of American adults experience some form of digital eye strain as a result of prolonged usage of digital devices. Luckily there are usually no long-term consequences of eye strain, but it can make your  digital viewing experience uncomfortable and inefficient.</p>

		Poor Posture

		<p>The increase in digital technology has forced humans into unusual body postures for extended periods of time. Using handheld digital devices frequently puts your head in an unnatural forward leaning position. Poorly designed ergonomics for computers and their input devices also cause musculoskeletal problems. When you tolerate these positions that put strain on your body, you may experience stress on your neck, shoulders, and spine.</p>
		<p> Studies have found a clear link between smartphone use, and neck, spine and back problems. Poor posture when using smartphone devices become habitual, and from this, arthritis, nerve pain, and headaches can arise. Finally, overuse of digital technology can also lead to repetitive strain injuries of the thumbs, fingers and wrists.</p>

		Sleep Disorders

		<p>Digital technology can interfere with your sleep in many ways, causing a multitude of problems. Many have become used to sleeping with their devices, habitually viewing their smartphones before sleep. However, the blue light exposure that devices emit can suppress melatonin and interrupt your circadian rhythm. Therefore digital technology directly interferes with your sleep, causing less sleep each day, and chronic sleep deprivation has some serious potential health effects.</p>
		<p>As a result, if device addiction at night is not addressed, then you will constantly be using time you should have been asleep on your device instead. This not only prevents your body and mind from recharging, but increases your chances of heart disease, kidney disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, stroke, obesity, and depression.</p>

		Physical Inactivity

		<p>Finally, spending more time with digital technology reduces the time you spend staying active. The link between overuse of digital devices and lower fitness and exercise levels is clear, and increased research has confirmed this link. This is because most of our daily digital devices are sedentary. When we work on a computer, browse our smartphones, watch television or our other digital devices, we are seated and generally inactive. When we spend most of our day on these digital devices, that's when the negative health effects of a sedentary lifestyle arise, contributing to obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and even cancer.</p>
		<p>Physical inactivity is the 4th leading risk factor for death, and estimated to contribute to almost 10% of premature deaths in 2008. With the COVID-19 pandemic, reliance on digital technology has only increased, creating an even greater need to offset physical inactivity.</p>
